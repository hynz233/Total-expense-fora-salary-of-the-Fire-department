# Total-expense-fora-salary-of-the-Fire-department
A week ago, my roommate and I have a little car accident. After calling 911, the Fire department became the first arrived officer. That was quite a surprising thing to me, because in my hometown China, the Fire department will not handle any car accident issue unless the accident causes any fire. Upon this, I suddenly started to wonder how much is the expanse for the salary of the fire department, since they look very reliable. So I investigate the total among of salary that the fire department needs to paid and some other interesting data such as average salary, highest salary, and the lowest salary. The result turns out that the fire department is spending at least 112750155 dollars every year for salary. And after applying linear regression to the data from 2015 to 2019, I found that the trend is going up at a high speed. And the R^2 value is 0.87, which indicates that the trend is rather reliable. Fire department is great, they help us a lot, and predictably, they will certainly increase their expense in the future just to protect us.<br>
